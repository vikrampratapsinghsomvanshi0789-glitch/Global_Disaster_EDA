# 🌍 Global Disaster EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

A data-driven exploration of global disasters to uncover trends, patterns, and insights using Python and popular data science libraries.

This project analyzes historical disaster data to understand:
• Frequency and types of disasters
• Impact across regions and years
• Relationships between disaster categories and damage
• Visual storytelling through graphs and statistics
